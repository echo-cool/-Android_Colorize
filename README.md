* Git Project Address: [https://git.echo.cool/UCD/Android_Colorize](https://git.echo.cool/UCD/Android_Colorize)

* **Project Overview**: This project builds an Android application that can restore the color of the old gray-scalimages. This application also has a build-in image editor, a community for posting recolored images and a top-usystem.
* **Grav-scale Image Recolor**: The functionality of image recolor was achieved by A **GAN** model. The model wadeployed on Baidu Cloud Computing Platform, using REST API for communication.
* **Tensorflow lite Embedded**: Tensorflow lite is a Bun-time library to let Tensorflow model runs on a mobilphone. In my application, image Bitmap is prepossessed to Tensorlmage in order to ft the input of the modelsolution enhancement model can enhance the quality of thhave two tflite models in mv applicationthe super-rimage and the stylization model can apply a customizable texture to an imageeg.
